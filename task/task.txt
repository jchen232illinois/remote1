The task's main purpose is to let you go through the whole process.

The goal is to get the image from the numpy array (arr.npy) file.

Detailed description is shown below:

	1. You should check out this repo from github, then extract the arr.7z file to get the arr.npy file. 

	2. Then you should copy the arr.npy file to the remote1 server. This contains the array you will work on.

	3. Then create a new jupyter notebook on the remote1 server, read the file, apply the necessary operations to the array.

	4. You should save the image, on your local disk, and decide whether they are legible images.

	5. If everything looks good, comment on the image content, for example, whether you like or dislike that.

Data structure of arr.npy:

	When you read the file using proper function in numpy library, you will get a 4 dimensional array. The first index correspond to the order of image, for example, arr[0] is the first image array and arr[2] is the third one. While the rest dimensions are the image data, i.e., arr[0] is a 3 dimensional array which the first and second index is the pixel data, while the last index is the channel for RGB color.
